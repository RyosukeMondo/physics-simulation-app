# Task 5 Implementation Summary

## Control Panel UI Implementation

### Components Created:
1. **ControlPanel.tsx** - Main UI component with buttons and object counter
2. **ControlPanel.css** - Styled overlay with modern design and responsive layout
3. **ObjectSpawner.tsx** - Component to render spawned physics objects
4. **useSimulation.ts** - Custom hook for state management
5. **simulation.ts** - Type definitions for spawned objects

### Features Implemented:
- ✅ Control panel overlays on 3D scene with backdrop blur effect
- ✅ "Add Ball" button spawns orange physics balls at random positions
- ✅ "Add Square" button spawns blue physics boxes at random positions  
- ✅ Object counter displays current number of spawned objects
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
- ✅ Hover effects and visual feedback on button interactions
- ✅ State management tracks all spawned objects with unique IDs
- ✅ Random position generation for natural object spawning
- ✅ Integration with existing PhysicsBall and PhysicsBox components

### Testing:
- ✅ Unit tests for ControlPanel component
- ✅ Unit tests for useSimulation hook  
- ✅ Integration tests for App component
- ✅ All tests passing (20/20)

### Requirements Satisfied:
- ✅ Requirement 6.1: Control panel displays on app load
- ✅ Requirement 6.2: Add Ball and Add Square buttons implemented
- ✅ Requirement 6.3: Immediate visual feedback on interactions

The control panel is now fully functional and ready for future enhancements like GLB loading, simulation controls, and reset functionality.
