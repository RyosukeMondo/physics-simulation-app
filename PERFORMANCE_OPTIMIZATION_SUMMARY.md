## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizer Architecture

```typescript
class PerformanceOptimizer {
  // Singleton pattern for global access
  static getInstance(): PerformanceOptimizer
  
  // Resource caching
  getCachedMaterial(key: string, factory: () => Material): Material
  getCachedGeometry(key: string, factory: () => BufferGeometry): BufferGeometry
  
  // Limit checking
  canAddObject(objects: SpawnedObject[], type: string): boolean
  
  // Performance monitoring
  getPerformanceStatus(objects, fps, memory): PerformanceStatus
  
  // Cleanup management
  performCleanup(): void
  registerCleanupCallback(callback: () => void): void
}
```

### Enhanced Simulation Hook

```typescript
const useSimulation = () => {
  // ... existing functionality
  
  // New performance features
  const [performanceWarnings, setPerformanceWarnings] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer.getInstance();
  
  // Limit checking before object creation
  if (!optimizer.canAddObject(objects, type)) {
    // Handle limit reached
  }
  
  // Auto-cleanup when approaching limits
  if (objects.length >= PERFORMANCE_LIMITS.CLEANUP_THRESHOLD) {
    const toRemove = optimizer.suggestObjectsForRemoval(objects, 3);
    // Remove oldest objects
  }
}
```

### Material and Geometry Caching

```typescript
// Before (creating new resources each time)
<mesh>
  <sphereGeometry args={[radius, 32, 32]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial color={color} />
</mesh>

// After (using cached resources)
const geometry = useMemo(() => {
  const geometryKey = createGeometryKey('sphere', [radius, 32, 32]);
  return optimizer.getCachedGeometry(geometryKey, () => new SphereGeometry(radius, 32, 32));
}, [radius, optimizer]);

const material = useMemo(() => {
  const materialKey = createMaterialKey('standard', color, { metalness: 0.1 });
  return optimizer.getCachedMaterial(materialKey, () => new MeshStandardMaterial({ color }));
}, [color, optimizer]);

<mesh geometry={geometry} material={material} />
```
